## Problem statement

A daily commuter knows her RIPTA route and stop down cold.  What she needs is to know the exact status of the bus for today's commute to and from work.  Team One Stop focused on how to present the exact information needed by this daily commuter, as quickly as possible.

We used the RIPTA trip updates and route API endpoints, pulling the relevant data and merging it into what was need to display the right info to the user. 

During the hackathon we completed just the first bit of functionality: showing status for the next buses on the commuter's selected route.  Over the coming weeks, we plan add notifications for service alerts on the commuter's daily routes, displaying current bus locations on a Google map, and more.
